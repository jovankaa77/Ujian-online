// This is a placeholder for the Silero VAD ONNX model
// In a real implementation, you would need to download the actual model file
// from the Silero VAD repository or the @ricky0123/vad-web package

// The actual file would be a binary ONNX model file
// For this demo, we're creating a placeholder that won't actually work
// but prevents 404 errors during development

console.log("Silero VAD model placeholder loaded");
